# Randomness Wrapper
Implementation of the paper "Limiting the impact of unreliable randomness in deployed security protocols" (https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1057.pdf)

# Problem Statement
Many sources of (ideally cryptographically-secured) random numbers can be unreliable.  

# Solution
The paper proposes a mechanism to significantly reduce the impact of untrusted randomness, and which is is compatible with, and effective in, existing deployments of protocols such as TLS.
